As part of my **'Teaching Computer Science in School'** module, me and my partner had the fantastic opportunity to plan and deliver a full-day Virtual Reality event for students at my placement school. Timed as a special treat before their half-term break, the day was designed to give many their very first taste of immersive technology.

This was inspired by how the school itself has been working towards developing a dedicated area for immersive learning, such as the space in the image. We had other ideas to hold competitions and such but we decided to be a little bit different!

### The Goal: A Hands-On Introduction

The main objective was to demystify VR and spark curiosity. We wanted to create a fun, interactive environment where students could not only try VR for themselves but also engage with us and ask questions about the technology, its uses, and how it works.

### Planning and Execution

To ensure the event was a success, we undertook several key responsibilities:

* **Logistical Coordination:** We collaborated with the University's **Collaborative Teaching Laboratory (CTL)** to prepare, check, and safely transport the VR headsets to the school.
* **Curating Experiences:** We selected a range of accessible and engaging VR experiences suitable for first-time users, offering them a broad sample of what's possible.
* **Running the Stations:** We set up and managed multiple VR stations, using our knowledge to guide the students, ensure their safety, and keep the event flowing smoothly throughout the day.
* **Interactive Q&A:** We facilitated an open forum where students could ask us anything, leading to some incredibly insightful and interesting conversations.

### Impact and Legacy

The event was a huge success and received fantastic feedback from both students and staff. I was especially proud to learn that our project had a lasting impact; the next cohort of students on the module reached out for advice and were inspired to run their own VR session at their placement, continuing the initiative we started.
