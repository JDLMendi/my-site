My personal website is my digital home, but I felt the previous design no longer represented my current skills or aesthetic. It was time for a complete refresh, focusing on a clean, modern, and content-first approach.

### The Philosophy Behind the Refresh

This redesign was guided by a few core principles:

* **Out with the Old:** I was unhappy with the previous design, which felt cluttered and dated. The goal was to start from a blank canvas and build an experience that was fresh, intuitive, and visually appealing.
* **A Modern, Clean Approach:** I wanted to embrace a more minimalist style. This meant focusing on clear typography, generous whitespace, and a simple colour palette to ensure the user experience was smooth and professional.
* **Focus on the Work:** The most important goal was to **put my projects front and centre**. The new layout is designed specifically to showcase what I've been making, allowing visitors to easily see and explore my work without distraction.
* **Cleaner Code, Better Foundation:** Beyond just the visuals, I wanted to improve the site under the hood. By rebuilding with Astro, I focused on writing cleaner, more maintainable code. This not only improves performance but also makes it much easier for me to add new projects and features in the future.

The result is a website that I feel is a truer representation of my work and a much more solid platform to build upon going forward.
