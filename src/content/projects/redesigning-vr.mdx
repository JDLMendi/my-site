### Project Overview
As part of my internship with the **Collaborative Teaching Laboratory (CTL)**, I was tasked with a critical project: redesigning the framework for how we deploy Virtual Reality in education. While the CTL has successfully used VR for instructor-led, small-group teaching, the existing methods were not built to scale.

As the deployment of VR scales from small groups to larger class sizes, the logistical and cognitive load on the instructor increases exponentially. This project's motivation was to develop a scalable and user-friendly framework that allows academics to seamlessly integrate VR into their curricula, ensuring the focus remains on pedagogy, not technological troubleshooting.

The project is built on three core pillars:
1.  **Headset Management and Infrastructure**
2.  **VR-Enabled Teaching Models**
3.  **A Streamlined Content Pipeline**

This post details the foundational work completed for the first pillar: creating a robust management infrastructure.

### The Challenge: Scaling from 10 to 30+ Headsets
The previous method of managing headsets with shared user accounts was adequate for a small fleet. However, with the lab's expansion to over 30 headsets, this system became untenable. Key challenges included:
* **Time-Consuming Setups:** Manually updating apps and system software on each device individually.
* **Inconsistency:** Ensuring every headset had the correct content and configuration for a given session.
* **Technical Limitations:** Running into Meta's two-headset limit for shared accounts on a single Wi-Fi network.

### The Solution: A Mobile Device Management (MDM) Framework
After researching alternatives, it was clear that a **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** solution was the only viable path forward for remote, at-scale management.

My research and implementation process involved:
1.  **Evaluating the New Landscape:** I discovered that a recent change—the introduction of **Meta Horizon Managed Service (HMS) in February 2025**—had fundamentally altered the ecosystem. All third-party MDMs now require devices to first be enrolled in HMS. This was a critical finding that shaped our entire strategy.
2.  **Comparative Analysis:** I conducted trials of two leading MDM platforms, **ManageXR** and **ArborXR**. Both offered the core functionality we needed, including remote content deployment, device configuration, and fleet monitoring.
3.  **Strategic Recommendation:** I recommended **ArborXR** as the CTL's chosen platform. While both were excellent, ArborXR provided the same essential feature set at a more cost-effective price point, making it the ideal choice for our use case.
4.  **Developing a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):** I created and documented a clear, step-by-step process for enrolling the entire fleet of headsets into the new HMS + ArborXR framework. This guide ensures that any team member can reliably provision new devices in the future.

### The Outcome: A Centralised, Scalable System
The new framework provides a robust foundation for all future VR teaching at the CTL. Key capabilities include:
* **Centralised Fleet Management:** We can now remotely push system updates, configure settings, and monitor the status (battery, connectivity) of all 32 headsets from a single web dashboard.
* **Effortless Content Deployment:** We can assign specific applications to groups of headsets, ensuring every student has the right experience for their lesson with a few clicks.
* **Simplified Asset Tracking:** I proposed a revised, more intuitive physical labeling convention (`CTL-VR(Model)-(Number)`) to make identifying headsets during a busy session much easier.

This foundational work dramatically reduces the setup time and technical burden on instructors, making large-scale VR sessions not just possible, but practical. The next steps of this project will involve building new teaching models on top of this reliable infrastructure.
